Smart Animal Watch Management
Modern animal management depends on accurate, real-time data to ensure the health, 
safety, and traceability of pets and livestock. Across North America, businesses in agriculture, 
veterinary care, animal shelters, and pet services rely on technology to meet growing demands in biosecurity, 
welfare compliance, and operational efficiency. By offering a suite of cloud-connected tracking and monitoring 
solutions, we help B2B clients improve visibility, streamline workflows, and ensure accountability—whether 
in remote pastures or dense urban settings. Our systems are built to scale, adapt, and integrate seamlessly 
with existing infrastructures, supporting a wide range of use cases from livestock identification to pet 
recovery. What sets us apart is our commitment to continuous product improvement, rigorous quality control, 
and responsive customer service tailored to each client’s environment. With a sharp focus on innovation and 
practicality, we deliver reliable tools that empower professionals to protect animals and optimize performance 
across the value chain.
