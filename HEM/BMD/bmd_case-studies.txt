Case Studies
U.S. – Cattle Health Optimization in Iowa
A commercial cattle farm deployed our biometric collars across 1,500 heads. 
Within three months, early fever detection led to a 30% drop in respiratory disease cases, 
reducing antibiotic use and increasing market yield.

U.S. – Smart Pet Health Monitoring in California
A pet boarding facility in San Diego integrated our wearables to monitor 
dogs with chronic conditions. Alerts helped prevent seizures and heat strokes, 
boosting customer satisfaction and staff efficiency

Canada – Dairy Herd Health Tracking in Ontario
A dairy operation in Ontario integrated biometric wearables and cloud analytics 
across its 500-cow operation. This enabled early mastitis detection and improved 
overall herd health, cutting veterinary costs by 25% annually.
