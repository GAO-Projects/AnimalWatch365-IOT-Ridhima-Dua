Thermal Cameras and IR Sensors
Temperature and heat patterns are often the earliest indicators 
of animal health issues or environmental problems. For caregivers, 
early detection can mean the difference between fast recovery and major loss. 
That’s why modern facilities are turning to advanced thermal imaging to enhance 
how they observe and protect animals. Pet & Livestock Industry provides cutting-edge 
Thermal Cameras and IR Sensors engineered to detect subtle changes in body temperature 
and surrounding heat signatures without the need for physical contact. These systems 
deliver high-resolution imagery and real-time alerts to identify signs of illness, injury, 
overcrowding, or heat stress across a wide range of environments, from veterinary clinics and 
shelters to farms and wildlife centers. Headquartered in Houston, TX, we’ve rapidly established 
ourselves as a trusted B2B partner in animal tracking technology across North America. With a 
focus on product reliability, continuous innovation, and customer-first support, our thermal 
systems integrate seamlessly into animal care operations and scale to meet growing demands
