Case Studies
Case Study 1 – U.S. Cattle Farm, Oklahoma
A large-scale cattle operation implemented our thermal cameras to monitor herd 
temperature during a seasonal heatwave. Within weeks, they detected early signs of 
heat stress, improving response times and reducing livestock losses by over 30%.

Case Study 2 – U.S. Animal Shelter, New Jersey
An urban shelter equipped with our infrared sensors was able to quickly 
identify and isolate animals with fevers, preventing the spread of an upper respiratory 
infection outbreak among over 100 dogs and cats.

Case Study 3 – Canadian Dairy Facility, Alberta
A mid-sized dairy farm used our infrared and thermal solutions to optimize 
calving conditions and detect mastitis early. The result was a 22% improvement 
in herd health scores and a measurable increase in milk production
