Hardware
Real-time thermal visualization dashboards – Enabled through 
Infrared Thermometers & Cameras to continuously monitor animal 
body heat signatures in pens and shelters.

Motion-triggered and heat-based alerts – 
Integrated with Motion & Position Sensorsto detect abnormal 
movements combined with elevated temperature for early illness detection

Automated image capture and data tagging – 
Powered by Optical & Imaging Sensorsfor capturing and tagging thermal 
imagery of individual livestock for behavior and health analysis

Customizable temperature thresholds and alert logic – 
Supported by Zigbee Gateways/Hubs  to locally manage sensor behavior 
and alert parameters at the hardware level

Multi-device management and sensor grouping – 
Achieved via LoRaWAN Gateways for scalable, long-range coordination of 
multiple thermal sensors across large farms

User permissions and access control settings – 
Managed using BLE Gateways, Beacons & Accessories to control 
physical access to thermal monitoring hardware in sensitive areas
