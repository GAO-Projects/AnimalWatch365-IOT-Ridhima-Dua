Case Studies
Poultry Farm – Arkansas, USA
A large poultry facility implemented our environmental sensors to monitor ammonia levels 
and temperature fluctuations. Within six months, they saw a 20% drop in mortality rates and a 
measurable improvement in feed efficiency through better climate control.
