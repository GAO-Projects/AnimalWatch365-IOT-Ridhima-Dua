Smart sensor systems are transforming how animal care environments are managed
Smart sensor systems are transforming how animal care environments are managed. 
By delivering continuous, real-time data, these technologies help farms, clinics, shelters, 
and pet care providers stay ahead of potential environmental stressors. Advanced analytics 
turn this data into actionable insights, supporting healthier, more productive animals. 
Environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, air quality, ammonia levels, and 
light exposure have a direct impact on animal health, behavior, and performance. 
Monitoring these factors allows early detection of risks and helps maintain optimal 
living conditions tailored to each species. Pet & Livestock Industry headquartered in Houston, 
TX, leads this innovation through rigorous testing, research-driven development, and a commitment to quality. 
With a growing B2B presence across North America, we offer scalable, customizable solutions backed by 
expert guidance and support.
