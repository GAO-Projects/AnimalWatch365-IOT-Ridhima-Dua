Advanced Accelerometers & Gyroscope Sensors for Precise Animal Behavior Tracking
Movement, posture, and behavior are critical indicators of animal health and our advanced 
sensor technology is designed to capture them all with precision. Pet & Livestock Industry 
delivers smart accelerometer and gyroscope solutions that monitor activity levels, detect rest cycles, 
and flag unusual patterns that may signal injury, illness, or distress. Integrated into wearables or 
combined with GPS and Bluetooth, these sensors enable continuous behavioral insights that empower early 
intervention and more personalized care. Designed for reliability in diverse environments, our 
systems are helping veterinarians, farmers, and animal care professionals across North America manage 
livestock and companion animals with greater efficiency, foresight, and confidence. These capabilities 
make our solutions ideal for B2B partners seeking smart, scalable animal monitoring tools.
