Case Studies
U.S. Case Study 1: Dairy Farm Lameness Prevention
A large dairy operation in Wisconsin implemented our accelerometer and 
gyroscope sensors to monitor cow mobility. Early detection of lameness reduced 
veterinary costs by 25% and increased milk production by improving animal comfort.

U.S. Case Study 2: Veterinary Clinic Pet Activity Monitoring
A veterinary practice in California adopted our wearable sensor 
technology to track recovery progress for post-surgery dogs. 
Real-time movement data helped vets tailor rehabilitation plans, 
improving patient outcomes and client satisfaction.

Canadian Case Study: Beef Cattle Behavior Analysis
A ranch in Alberta integrated our sensor system with GPS trackers 
to study grazing patterns and detect stress in cattle. 
The system enabled timely interventions that enhanced herd health and optimized pasture use.
