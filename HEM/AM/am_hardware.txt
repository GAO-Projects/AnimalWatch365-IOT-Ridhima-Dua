Hardware
High-sensitivity directional microphones: Utilized BLE Gateways, Beacons 
& Accessories to capture and transmit sound data from specific animal zones with precision.

Wide-frequency unidirectional sound sensors: Integrated with Wi-Fi HaLow 
End Devices for localized detection of vocal stress signals or distress calls in livestock environments.

Noise-canceling enclosures for focused detection: Paired with LoRaWAN 
End Devices to isolate and transmit only relevant animal acoustic signals across long distances.

Weatherproof casings for indoor/outdoor use: Combined with Wi-Fi 
HaLow End Devicesto enable consistent sound monitoring regardless of environmental exposure

Mounting kits for stalls, cages, ceilings, and pens: 
Supported by Z-Wave Accessories to allow easy installation and alignment 
of acoustic sensors across different enclosures.

Edge-processing modules for local signal filtering: 
Enabled through Device Edge hardware for real-time, on-site sound pattern filtering before transmission.
