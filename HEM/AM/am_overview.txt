Smart Environmental Monitoring for Animal Wellness
Early signs of animal distress or abnormal behavior often 
emerge through subtle acoustic cueswell before any physical 
symptoms become visible. By interpreting these sound patterns, 
animal care professionals can respond swiftly to prevent illness, 
injury, or operational issues. Pet & Livestock Industry delivers cutting-edge Acoustic 
Monitoring (Sound Sensors) designed for non-invasive, around-the-clock surveillance of animal environments. 
Our smart sensors capture variations in vocalization, movement sounds, and ambient noise to flag early 
signs of stress, aggression, respiratory conditions, and even equipment failure. Built for use in farms, 
shelters, clinics, and pet boarding facilities, these systems offer proactive insights and instant 
alerts that enhance animal welfare and facility management. Headquartered in Houston, TX, we serve 
B2B clients across North America with intelligent, scalable technologies backed by responsive 
support and a commitment to continuous innovation
