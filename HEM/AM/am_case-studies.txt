Case Studies
Case Study 1: Swine Facility, Iowa, USA
A large swine operation integrated our acoustic sensors to 
monitor piglet vocalizations during farrowing. Alerts for elevated stress 
helped staff intervene earlier, reducing mortality rates by 18% over six months.

Case Study 2: Veterinary Clinic, Oregon, USA
A busy veterinary hospital deployed our sound sensors to 
detect overnight animal distress. One system identified recurring 
nocturnal agitation in recovering pets, leading to modified medication schedules and faster healing

Case Study 3: Dog Rescue Shelter, Ontario, Canada
Our technology helped a nonprofit shelter analyze barking patterns to 
distinguish anxiety from aggression. With data-driven adjustments to kennel 
airings, aggression incidents dropped by 40% within two months
