Case Studies

U.S. Dairy Farm Enhances Herd Management

A large dairy operation in Wisconsin implemented 
our RFID tag system to automate daily herd tracking 
and milk production monitoring. This reduced manual labor 
by 30% and improved health record accuracy, contributing 
to higher milk yields.

U.S. Animal Shelter Streamlines Adoption Processes

A shelter in California adopted our RFID microchip 
solution for pet identification and tracking. 
This increased recovery rates of lost pets by 
40% and streamlined the adoption check-out process with quick 
access to medical and ownership records

Canadian Livestock Ranch Boosts Traceability

A cattle ranch in Alberta integrated our RFID tags with 
their herd management software to meet Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency standards. This enabled precise 
traceability during transport and sales, enhancing 
compliance and operational transparency.
