Subdermal RFID Microchips for Permanent Animal Identification

Microchips (Subdermal RFID) offer an efficient, permanent, 
and tamper-proof identification method for pets and livestock. 
Implanted under the skin, these biocompatible RFID tags carry unique 
ID numbers readable by compatible scanners. This solution eliminates risks 
associated with lost visual tags or stolen animals, ensuring consistent 
traceability throughout an animalâ€™s life. At Animal Watch 365 Technologies, 
we offer advanced subdermal RFID microchips that align with both U.S. and 
Canadian traceability regulations, and seamlessly integrate into your digital 
livestock management systems. Headquartered in Houston, TX, our company leads 
the industry in secure, innovative, and reliable animal ID technologies that 
empower North American ranchers, breeders, veterinarians, and animal control 
professionals to operate smarter and with greater confidence.
