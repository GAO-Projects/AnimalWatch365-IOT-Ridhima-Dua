Case Studies
U.S. – Texas Cattle Co-op (Amarillo, TX) 
A ranching co-op in Texas integrated subdermal
microchips across over 2,000 head of cattle, 
reducing ID loss by 98%. Combined with digital health 
records and USDA reporting automation, the solution saved 
over 500 man-hours per season and improved compliance rates significantly

U.S. – County Animal Shelter (San Bernardino, CA)
This public shelter transitioned from visual tags
to RFID microchips for stray pet intakes. Scan-and-match 
capabilities dramatically reduced misidentification cases and 
shortened reunification times from days to under 12 hours in 84% of cases.

Canada – Ontario Goat Dairy Network (Guelph, ON) 
A network of dairy goat farms across Ontario deployed 
subdermal RFID chips to meet CCIA and provincial biosecurity standards. 
Combined with handheld RFID readers and traceability software, 
farmers improved lineage tracking, health monitoring, and milk 
production records while enhancing disease trace-back capabilities.
