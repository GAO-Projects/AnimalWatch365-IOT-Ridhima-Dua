Case Studies
Texas Equine Rescue Center (USA)
A nonprofit equine rescue implemented QR-coded neck 
labels to manage health and ownership records for over 400 horses. 
Volunteers used smartphones to instantly retrieve medical histories 
and adoption readiness, reducing administrative errors by 70%.

Missouri Swine Production Facility (USA)
A pork producer in Missouri used barcode labels linked to health 
certificates and feeding data. Integrated with a farm management system, 
the barcodes enabled real-time insights during growth phases and ensured 
full traceability during processing

Ontario Sheep Genetics Program (Canada)
An agricultural co-op in Ontario adopted QR-labeled 
identification cards for a genetics tracking project. 
Farmers scanned the tags using a mobile app to log breeding 
cycles, performance data, and vaccination recordsâ€”streamlining 
operations for over 2,000 ewes across 14 farms
