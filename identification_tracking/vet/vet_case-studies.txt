Case Studies
Nebraska Cattle Operation (USA)
A 3,000-head cattle ranch in Nebraska adopted our 
color-coded visual ear tags to identify age, breed, 
and health status at a glance. By integrating with their 
digital records and using barcode add-ons, the operation 
reduced veterinary inspection time by 28% during seasonal health checks

North Carolina Goat Dairy Farm (USA)
A mid-sized dairy farm in North Carolina used our 
custom-printed visual ear tags to separate breeding 
groups and manage milk production lines. The tagsâ€™ visibility 
helped prevent accidental crossbreeding and improved recordkeeping efficiency.

Alberta Sheep Cooperative (Canada)
A cooperative of sheep farmers in Alberta implemented 
visual ear tags with bright color-coding by age and flock. 
This low-tech solution, combined with mobile record entry, 
simplified rotational grazing schedules and allowed for quick, 
remote visual audits by co-op members
