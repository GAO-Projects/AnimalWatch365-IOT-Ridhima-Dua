Case Studies
US Veterinary Hospital
A vet hospital in Houston implemented our Wi-Fi Enabled Tags 
to monitor recovery rooms. With movement-triggered alerts, staff 
improved post-op animal care and reduced intervention time by 40%.

US New York Dog Daycare Facility
A pet daycare in Brooklyn uses our Wi-Fi tags to track over 100 dogs daily. 
Geo-zones and inactivity alerts boosted response times for pets in distress 
and improved facility transparency with customers

CA British Columbia Goat Farm
A dairy goat farm in interior BC installed Wi-Fi trackers across multiple barns. 
With real-time stall-level tracking, the farm reduced manual checks and identified 
health issues earlier, improving overall herd well-being.
