Case Studies
US North Carolina Equine Training Center
A horse rehabilitation and training facility installed our UWB Locators to 
monitor injured horses in enclosed arenas. The real-time location data helped trainers 
ensure safety, optimize exercise schedules, and improve recovery results

US San Diego Animal Research Campus
This university-operated research facility integrated UWB into its 
primate enclosures for behavior study. The high-precision movement data 
enabled researchers to automate behavioral mapping, resulting in more accurate, less intrusive studies.

CA Alberta Bison Reserve
A bison conservation group in Alberta deployed UWB Locators in semi-domesticated 
herds for safety tracking and stress-reduction studies. Tag-based alerts prevented 
accidents in restricted zones and helped researchers monitor micro-movements
