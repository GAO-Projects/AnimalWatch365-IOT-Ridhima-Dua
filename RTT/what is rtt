What Is Real-Time Tracking?
Real-time tracking involves the use of digital 
devices—typically wearable or attachable tags—that transmit 
continuous or near-continuous location data to a central dashboard or app. 
These systems allow you to:

Monitor the exact location of animals at any given moment
Set up geo-fencing alerts for boundary breaches
Track behavior, movement, and rest cycles
React swiftly to emergencies or unusual activity
Our real-time trackers use a variety of wireless 
technologies—tailored to different environments and 
species—to ensure consistent and actionable data delivery.
