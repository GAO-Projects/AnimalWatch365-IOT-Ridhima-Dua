Case Studies
US Texas Cattle Ranch
A 15,000-acre ranch in West Texas implemented LoRaWAN trackers across 3,000 cattle. 
This led to a 70% reduction in labor hours spent locating animals and improved detection 
of health anomalies, contributing to lower mortality rates and faster intervention times

US Colorado Sheep Cooperative
A coalition of sheep ranchers in Colorado deployed shared LoRaWAN 
gateways and trackers to collectively monitor herds across shared grazing grounds. 
The cooperative reported a 50% boost in productivity and better planning for rotational grazing

CA Alberta Bison Reserve
A conservation initiative in Alberta adopted LoRaWAN trackers for bison health monitoring. 
Data collected was used for university-led research and helped inform new habitat management 
practices without disturbing the animals.
