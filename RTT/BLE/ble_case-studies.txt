Case Studies
US California Pet Shelter Network
A regional network of animal shelters in Southern California deployed 
BLE trackers across three facilities to monitor pet movement zones and 
reduce staff search time. Staff efficiency increased by 40% and escape incidents were reduced to near zero

US North Carolina Goat Farm
A goat dairy farm utilized BLE tags within their enclosed barn to track resting 
and activity times, correlating it with milk yield. The operation optimized feeding 
schedules and improved herd health outcomes

CA British Columbia Veterinary Institute
A veterinary research institute in BC implemented BLE trackers for canine and feline patients post-surgery. 
Proximity-based motion monitoring improved recovery oversight, allowing early detection of potential complications
