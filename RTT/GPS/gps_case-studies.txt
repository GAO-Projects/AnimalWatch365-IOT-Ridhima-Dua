Case Studies
US Ranching Cooperative
A 20,000-acre cattle ranch in Central Texas integrated our GPS tracking collars 
into their livestock operation. Theft prevention alerts and daily route mapping 
helped reduce labor by 35% and minimize loss by 90%.

US Colorado Mountain Pet Rescue
A non-profit rescue organization used our GPS collars for dogs in foster care 
and wilderness rehab. The live tracking capability dramatically improved safety and 
location response time during off-leash exercises.

CA Alberta Elk Conservation Project
Working with a wildlife conservation team in Alberta, 
we deployed GPS satellite collars to track elk migration. 
Data collected over 12 months was used to inform land use policies and 
protect habitats affected by urban expansion
